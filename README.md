# file-based-CRD-operations
This repository is created against assignment given by Freshworks

As given in the problem statement, we have to implement CRD operations on JSON file.
For using these operations (Create, Read, Delete) one can do it using three ways:
1. Using REST APIs
2. By using operation functions in different module for mentioned data
3. By importing data from another JSON file

This project also allows user to test functionality.
